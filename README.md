# Malware Protection using Reverse Engineering - Capstone Project Phase 02

## Overview

This repository contains ongoing work on malware protection using reverse engineering. Please note that this project is still in progress, and updates will continue to be made to the repository.


## Project Details

This Capstone project focuses on malware protection through the application of reverse engineering techniques. The work is divided into two phases, with each phase addressing specific aspects of malware and protection mechanisms.

### Phase 02 - Summary

#### Review 1
- Advanced C2
- Advanced Persistence
- Fileless malware
- DLL Hijacking
- Process Hooking

#### Review 3
- Polymorphic and Metamorphic malware
- Evasion Techniques
- Anti-reverse engineering techniques
- Protection schemes like anti-viruses and sandboxes

These PowerPoint presentations, "Phase 02 Review 1" and "Phase 02 Review 3," provide summaries of the work completed in the respective parts. 

#### Final Phase 02 dissertation
The final dissertation summarizes all the work done in Phase 02 of the Capstone project.
It highlights some additional malware topics that have not been previously covered in the two review presentations:
- Macros
- Fileless Malware and Double Pulsar emulation
- PowerShell as an attack and defense vector

The dissertation concludes with the malware environment setup and analysis of RedLine Stealer, a real-world information stealer malware.

### DISCLAIMER!!
Malware samples will be uploaded into this repository once all comprehesive malware analysis reports are ready. 
The analysis and documentation of malware samples in this repository are strictly for educational and research purposes. The intention behind this project is to enhance understanding of malware workings and promote proactive defense strategies. The use of malware samples for any malicious or unauthorized activities is strictly prohibited.
